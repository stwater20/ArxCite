# ArxCite - Semantic Search in Academic Papers Using Embedding Models

The goal of this project is to develop a semantic search system for academic papers, specifically focused on the arXiv repository. Current academic search engines like Google Scholar and Scopus rely heavily on keyword-based search, which can fail to capture the semantic nuances of sentences. This limitation hinders researchers seeking precise information within a vast amount of scientific literature.

To address this issue, we propose a system that enables users to input a sentence and retrieve semantically similar sentences from arXiv papers. This approach utilizes sentence embeddings generated by state-of-the-art language models like Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and compares embeddings using cosine similarity. The proposed system aims to bridge the gap between usersâ€™ queries and the underlying knowledge in academic papers by focusing on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matches.

This method offers a new way to perform semantic retrieval, and it provides a means to benchmark against traditional keyword-based search systems.
